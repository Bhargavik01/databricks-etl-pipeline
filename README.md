**Databricks ETL Pipeline with PySpark**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains an ETL pipeline project developed using Databricks and PySpark. The pipeline is structured with layered storage in Azure Blob Storage, implementing the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layer architecture. It ingests raw data, processes and cleans the data, and prepares it for aggregations, all using Delta Lake.

**Pipeline Layers**

Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion.
Silver Layer: Data cleaning and transformation.
Gold Layer: Aggregated and enriched data ready for analysis.

**Technologies Used**

Databricks: For running and managing the PySpark jobs.
PySpark: To process and transform the data.
Azure Blob Storage: As the storage for raw, cleaned, and aggregated data.
Delta Lake: For managing and querying large data volumes.
Azure Databricks: Integration with Azure to process large datasets efficiently.

**Future Enhancements**

Add real-time streaming for the ETL pipeline.
Integrate with visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.
Automate the pipeline using Azure Data Factory.
